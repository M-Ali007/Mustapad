# Mustapad

### Inspiration
I thought that this could be a great additon to my setup and I could learn a lot from doing this so I made this. It was hard but I learnt a bunch.

### Challenges
This was pretty hard - I've never done anything like this ever - but it all paid off and I have a super cool design now
